# Peaky Blinders App

This project is fetching data from `The Movie Database Api`. In order to do that you will have to go on their site and obtain a key.

After that go in the `App.js` file and on the `line 15` :
 **const apiKey = null** replace null with a string that contains your personal key of access.

The search bar will filter the cards based on the actors' names
and their characters' names.

For starting the React App run `npm start`.
